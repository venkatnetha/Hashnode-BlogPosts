If 2020 summer can be described as De-Fi summer and 2021 summer as summer of NFTs, I believe 2022 summer can be aptly described as GameFi summer as the growth is set to extend 2000% from the Q1 of 2021.

At the center of GameFi lies blockchain enabled paly2earn video games. As the name suggests, play-to-earn (or P2E) crypto games involve earning some form of cryptocurrency by playing games.

You can typically exchange this in-game currency for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another token on a decentralized exchange.

NFTs are not just a bored ape jpeg or for that matter a profile picture, they are more than just a digital ownership. There are lot more real-life use cases with NFTs which have the potential to change the way we interact, trade, prove identity and in many ways in the foreseeable future.

The total sale of NFTs was estimated at 12 Million USD during December 2021 but exploded to 340 Million USD within just two months (February 2021). Such skyrocket development makes NFTs become a craze, or some described them as future of digital assets.
